# Dronology-Community-Datasets


Many software engineering research projects rely upon the availability of software engineering data, such as requirements, source code, architectural design etc, for experimentation purposes. However, it can be challenging to acquire extensive data sets outside the Open Source domain.

One of our goals is to openly share Dronology datasets. While we are currently in an incubation stage, we provide a small 'taste' of what we are working towards releasing, including requirements, design, code, test cases, product line information, and safety analysis -- all across multiple versions.
